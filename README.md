# NYMBAZAAR - the first marketplace powered by NYM MIXNET 

## QUICKSTART

- we have a server and a client fun
1. to test server 
```
cd server && cargo run --bin nymbazaar-server
```
2. in a second terminal run client:

```
## copy the --bazaar-id from the previous server terminal
cd client && cargo run --bin nymbazaar-client -- --bazaar-id <SERVER_NYM_ADDRESS>

```
